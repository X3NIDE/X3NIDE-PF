            <h2>HOW LONELINESS AFFECTS OUR SENSES</h2>

            <p>Sasuke Uchiha (うちはサスケ, Uchiha Sasuke) is one of the last surviving members of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan.
                After his older brother, Itachi, slaughtered their clan, Sasuke made it his mission in life to avenge
                them by killing Itachi. He is added to Team 7 upon becoming a ninja and, through competition with his
                rival and best friend Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke starts developing his skills. Dissatisfied with his
                progress, he defects from Konoha so that he can acquire the strength needed to exact his revenge. His
                years of seeking vengeance and his actions that followed become increasingly demanding, irrational and
                isolates him from others, leading him to be branded as an international criminal. After learning the
                truth of his brother's sacrifice, later proving instrumental in ending the Fourth Shinobi World War, and
                being happily redeemed by Naruto, Sasuke decides to return to Konoha and dedicate his life to help
                protect the village and its inhabitants, becoming referred to as the "Supporting Kage" (支う影, Sasaukage,
                literally meaning: Supporting Shadow).</p> <br>

            <p>
                Kakashi Hatake (はたけカカシ, Hatake Kakashi) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Hatake clan. Famed as Kakashi of
                the Sharingan (写輪眼のカカシ, Sharingan no Kakashi), he is one of Konoha's most talented ninja, regularly
                looked to for advice and leadership despite his personal dislike of responsibility. To his students on
                Team 7, Kakashi emphasises the importance of teamwork; he himself received this lesson, along with the
                Sharingan, from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha. After the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes
                Konoha's Sixth Hokage (六代目火影, Rokudaime Hokage, literally meaning: Sixth Fire Shadow).

            <h2>A LOST SOUL OF AN OLD WARRIOR</h2>
            <p>Itachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ, Uchiha Itachi) was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu
                Captain. He later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his
                younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki,
                whose activity brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke who
                sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi. Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be
                more complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the interest of his brother and
                village, making him remain a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.</p> <br>
